This project is an AI-powered Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the computer predicts and counters the player's most frequent moves. The AI adapts based on the player's history, making the game more challenging and strategic.

Project Explanation
The AI analyzes past player moves and selects the best counter-strategy.
The game maintains real-time score tracking for player, computer, and tie results.
A visual representation of move history is generated using Matplotlib to analyze player tendencies.
Results
Players can observe their move distribution and identify patterns in their gameplay.
The AI adapts over time, making it harder to win with repetitive strategies.
A final score summary and graphical report help players review their performance.
